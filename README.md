Before doing linear regression, the following steps were done: 
      Read in and Clean Dataset 
      Check for Encoding categorical variables
Dropping unnecessary columns
Binning any large range categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis
Examing the distribution of features
Examining and plotting correlation between variables, i.e. HeatMap
Detecting and Handling outliers
Linear Regression
  Testing Assumption 1: Linear Relationship
  Testing Assumption 2: Multicollinearity
  Checking Normal Distribution
